No more international version; all languages are included by default. Fixed minor grouping display issue. Using $templateCache for templates instead of global namespace.\n* __2013-03-05__ - Version 2.0.0 - Breaking Changes: see documentation (showSelectionBox, enableRowSelection, showFooter). Column Virtualization added. Row virtualization performance improved. Excel-like editing instead of enableFocusedCellEdit.\n* __2013-02-18__ - Version 1.9.0 - Aggregates now display correctly. Added more option methods to select and group data (see wiki), Added column pinning.\n* __2013-02-11__ - Version 1.8.0.hotfix - Fixes for multi-level grouping and adding the gridId to both the grid options and as argument to the \"ngGridEventData\" so you can identify what grid it came from.\n* __2013-02-07__ - Version 1.8.0 - Major architectural changes which greatly improves performance. virtualizationThreshold now controlls when virtualization is force-enabled and is user-specified in options.\n* __2013-02-06__ - Version 1.7.1 - Fixed bug with selections and multiple grids. New emit message for notifying when hitting bottom of viewport. Can disable virtualization. ng-grid virtualization is on by default, but can be disabled if there are less than 50 rows in the grid. Anything > 50 rows virtualization is forced on for performance considerations.\n* __2013-02-05__ - Version 1.7.0 - BREAKING CHANGES: Will add examples.

Fixed #93.\n* __2013-01-09__ - Version 1.6.2 - Merged changes to have two-way data-binding work in templates, so if you're using a celltemplate, you can now use COL_FIELD instead of row.getProperty(col.field). row.getProperty is still in the row class for accessing other row values.\n* __2013-01-08__ - Version 1.6.1 - Adding ability to preselect rows. Can deselect when multiSelect:false. Bug fixes/merging pull requests. Bower now works. Can now sync external search with ng-grid internal search.
