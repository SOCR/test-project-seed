        span.label.label-important Goal:
        | Propose and implement a new infrastructure modernizing current SOCR Wiki resources.
        |The new architecture should consume the meta-data from the current SOCR MediaWiki DB and
        | the interface should be mobile ready. There are existing scripts to convert markdown MediaWiki
        | syntax to HTML. Use these scripts and bootstrap to modernize the SOCR Wiki interface.
        |The new frameworks should also allow easy editing (with limited access only to trusted SOCR personnel).
